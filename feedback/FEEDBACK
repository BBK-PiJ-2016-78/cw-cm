Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

Reasonable set of tests.

Please see any feedback from the analysis tools.

Add javadoc for private fields and methods.

Only need to make the CM impl class serialisable as that then 
covers the other objects.

Interesting use of abstract class for meeting.

Good use of Java 8 constructs.

Some of the code could have been refactored to save duplication.

File names tend to be constants.

Very good effort. Distinction.
